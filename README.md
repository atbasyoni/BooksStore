# Book Store API
# Project Overview

Book Store API built using ASP.NET Core Web API. The project incorporates the principles of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) for a modular and maintainable codebase. It also includes features like JWT and Refresh Token for secure authentication and authorization. AutoMapper is utilized for efficient object mapping, and the API exposes three controllers: Book, Author, and Genre.

  },
```
- And you can make Your key from here  'https://8gwifi.org/jwsgen.jsp'

- Install Packages from **NuGet Package Manager** Or **Package Manager Console**
```
    Install-Package AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
    Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
    Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
    Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
    Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
    Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
    Install-Package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
```

- In **Package Manager Console** make Db migration using command

```cmd
Add-Migration InitialMigration
```
- Write another command to update the database

```cmd
Update-Database
```
- Change the connection string (SQL Server, username & password )

```json
 "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=[Server Name];Initial Catalog=[DataBase Name];User ID=[Sql server Username];Password=[Sql server Password];Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;Trust Server Certificate=True;Application Intent=ReadWrite;Multi Subnet Failover=False"
